PROG Recipe_POE Part 1 

This project is designed to help users, like Sanele, manage and interact with recipes. Upon running the program, users are prompted to enter details for a new recipe, including its name, ingredients with quantities and measurements, and the preparation steps. Once a recipe is entered, users can choose from several options. They can display the recipe in a printed colour(green), scale the recipe by a specified factor to adjust the ingredient quantities, reset the quantities to their original values, enter a new recipe, or exit the program. This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive way for users, like Sanele, to manage and work with their recipes, allowing for easy adjustments and organization.


How I Improved for Part 2

I took the feedback given to me by Mr.Kim after Part 1, and analyzed it so that I know exactly what I must do so that it meets the rubric. Firstly, I fixed the error I made for the scaling option. Secondly, it would scale the values by whatever the user chose (0.5, 2 or 3) and it wouldn't display the recipe after that and it wouldn't reset the changed values back to their original values. So I fixed that. Then I needed to make the comments more meaningful and create seperators between each method to make it look more put together and tidy, like Dr Rudolph wants it. Lastly, I needed to implement error handling.

How I Improved for Part 3

I took the feedback given to me by Mr.Kim after part 2, and knew exactly what I must add to my application so that it meets the needs of the rubric. Firstly, I made sure thta everything in part 1 was working smoothly in my new application, offered an explanation on what calories/foodgroups are, the different food group options and made sure there are alerts for calorie consumption and will make my read me file have more information on how the user should run my application.
